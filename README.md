The scripts found in this section have a single purpose, a didactic goal. The damage caused by these scripts will be borne solely by the user. Good learning!.

For any improvement or criticics, you can reach me by email adamsjoe96@gmail.com. or on the chat of forum developpez.com in the General Development section. Just log in and DO YOHOHOHOHOHO! ;) and I would know.

So Enjoy!
